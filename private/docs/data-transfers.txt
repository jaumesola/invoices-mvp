FUNCTIONS USED FOR DATA TRANSFERS IN EACH EXECUTION MODE

Application

- config.fillFormFromDoc -- used when editing to fill from from doc obtained from DB
- config.fillDocFromForm -- used when saving to DB to fill doc with data from  form

Tests in general
- config.fakeData: creates a generic object with fake but valid data

Unit tests

- config.fakeDoc: creates a document object from config.fakeData
- config.extractDataFromHtml -- returns an array of data rows & columns presented on screen 
     in order to compare with previously entered fake data
     
Integration tests

- they do little at the moment, there's duplication between the three kind of tests,
  it's not decided yet which kind should do what and when it's worth duplicating
       
Functional tests

- they use config.fakeData to fill the browser form with fake data 

(currently a verification of data entered is missing, but we already do it in unit tests)
